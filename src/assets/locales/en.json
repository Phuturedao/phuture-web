  "landing_second_block_title": "Smart, Scalable Index Architecture",
  "landing_second_block_text": "Phuture’s aggregated design achieves scalability by allowing a single swap to rebalance multiple indices simultaneously. The protocol’s smart rebalancing engine calculates the optimal assets to rebalance and dynamically defines acceptable weight ranges to rebalance in. The cumulative result of this architecture is a platform that can support 100s of indices, whilst minimising the value leaked through rebalancing swaps.",
  "landing_third_block_title": "Liquidity Nexus",
  "landing_third_block_text": "Index investors can tap into the deepest sources of liquidity on the Ethereum ecosystem providing best execution and the broadest selection of assets. Phuture effectively separates trade execution during the minting process from the amount of liquidity held in an index fund. This ensures the same user experience regardless of index size and removes the cumbersome liquidity onboarding phase for new indices.",
  "landing_fourth_block_title": "Permissionless Index Creation",
  "landing_fourth_block_text": "Phuture introduces an open design philosophy for creating passive investment strategies, providing the tools for users to create new indices, or invest into existing ones created by the community. The Phuture Index Creator can support an array of index options including automated sector tracking and dynamic weighting methodologies.",
